        <p>Currently academically, I am following a Coding Boot Camp at University Of North Carolina â€“ Chapel Hill. I am glad the decision I made as a first step toward a future-proof career. I believe that this is a great opportunity to use the knowledge that I have acquired through studies and to gain IT experience.
           </p>

           <p>In addition to the IT knowledge, I was graduated from Glyndwr University Wrexham United Kingdom in B.Sc. Architectural Design Technology. My previous work experiences as a Quantity Surveyor and in the Architectural industry for 6 years will be extremely helpful in successfully overcoming critical situations in the working environment.
